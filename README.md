# Design Patterns

## Definitions

- An **object** packages both data and procedures (**methods** or **operations**) that operates on that data.
- An object performas an operation when it receives **request** (or **message**) from a **client**.
- **Encapsulation**: requests are the *only* way to get an object to execute an operation, operations are the *only* way to change an object's internal data.
- The operation's name, objects it takes as parameters and the objects return value combined is called the operation's **signature**. A set of defined signatures is called the **interface**.

## Important Leanrings

The hard part about object-oriented design is decomposing a system into objects. Many factors influence the decomposition, often in conflicting ways. There will always be disagreement on which approach is best.

Strict modeling may reflect today's needs but not tomorrow, abstraction is key to making design flexible.
